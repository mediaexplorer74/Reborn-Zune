![Zune Logo](Artwork/Zune-Reburn.png)

## Words "forked" from author of Reborn Zune :)
"Glad you find this repo. If you've heard about Zune, you would be glad that this repo is all about 
combining the fasinating and attractive elements from Zune with Fluent design.
If not, I wish this repo, this app would provide you a new level of experience of music player app."

## My 2 cents
- "Zune theme" mini-research (design, animations, et.c)
- Minimal bug workarounds / fixes
- Dirty W10M design "optimization" ("minification"?) :)
- UWP Codebase downgraded to SDK 15063 (pacthing DB SQL methods, xaml compatibility, etc.)

### What is
This is a music player that plays local music files in your library. 
Thanks to the UWP community for providing so much useful and nice open source, 
we are able to bring the Tile wall from Zune to this app

### What is not
Although this project named as Reborn Zune, this is not a full porting version of Zune on UWP, 
aka having the same user interface, same information hierachy, same experience, etc.

One of the reasons is that although Zune is known about its user interface, 
we should recognize that the rich online music resources also complete the experience of Zune.

In fact, the Zune-Reburn's author only bring the most attractive element, 
at least (by his/m opinion) it is the most attractive one on Zune, to this app. 
Of course, as a dev who really cares about user experience and UI design, 
there's no way to not having Fluent design implemented in a modern UWP app. 
During you usage, you would experience the combination of the old Metro Design 
and the modern Fluent Design.

## Status
- Draft / Alpha (or even pre-alpha) mode at now
- Many features damaged via "15063 downshifting". For example, full thumbnails tile malfunction! 

## Environment
- Windows SDK Target Version: 10.0.19041.0
- Windows SDK Min. Version:   10.0.15063.0
